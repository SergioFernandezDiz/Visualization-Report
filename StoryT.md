## Now let's analyze Ticino in detail.

Ticino is a relatively small canton in Switzerland, with a total population of **357,720**. A significant portion of its wealth comes from tourism. Now that we have an overview of Switzerland, let's look into general trends in Ticino, areas with higher traffic volumes, and annual traffic patterns.

In the last years, traffic in **Ticino** has followed an **upward trend**, except for two significant events. The first occurred around **2008** during the **financial crisis**, where we can observe a **40% decrease**, possibly due to the lack of **tourism**, which drastically reduced the **annual average**. Analyzing the **Covid-19 period**, we notice a decrease of about **50%**, caused by both **lockdowns** and the **absence of tourism**. What is particularly interesting is comparing the decline in **Ticino** with the **national average in Switzerland**, which shows the importance of the flow driven by **workers** and **tourists**, as the Swiss average was impacted by approximately **23%**. The final observation pertains to the period after **Covid-19**, where we can notice that **traffic levels have not yet returned** to the same values as before.

Analyzing the trend over the year (2023), we can observe a clear pattern. Starting from **January**, there is a strong increase in **traffic** on the roads, reaching its **peak** around **June** and **August**, before declining again towards **December**. This is due to the various movements during **vacation periods**, with **families traveling abroad** and **tourists arriving in Ticino** to spend their holidays.

## Worse places in Ticino

Now let's take a closer look at how traffic is distributed in the Ticino area. Is it primarily influenced by the number of people coming from central Switzerland, or is it driven by the daily commuters who travel to work across the border?

By analyzing the top 6 counting stations from **2003 to 2023**, we can observe that the flow of vehicles between **central Switzerland** and **Ticino**, passing through the **Moleno Nord** counting station (A2 motorway), is the area with the **highest vehicle volume**, reaching an average of **100,000 vehicles per day**. In addition to this station, we also notice high values at the **Grancia**, **Lugano C** stations, and an increase around **2017** at **Chiasso**, near the **Italian border**.

This analysis highlights a significant flow on the highways leading to the **San Gottardo Pass**, likely due to **commuters traveling to central Switzerland for work**. Moreover, we can also observe the flow of **cross-border workers**, primarily passing through the **customs checkpoint in Chiasso**. All this traffic then converges in the area near **Lugano**, creating traffic issues.

This map has been created for **daily use**, as it shows the **average vehicle speed**, updated every **30 minutes**. An interesting observation is the **central area of Lugano**, where even during **non-peak times**, such as in the evening, the **average speed** remains much lower than the **permitted speed limit**. This is due to the presence of **many traffic lights**, which slow down movement. As a result, this can lead to an increase in **traffic** even when the number of vehicles is low.

## Final Summary of the Analysis

Through this analysis, we have observed that both at the **national level** in Switzerland and at the **Ticino level**, the issue of **traffic congestion** continues to rise. We have also noticed that traffic in **Ticino** is heavily influenced by the presence of both **tourists** and **cross-border workers**, as well as by significant events like the **Covid-19 pandemic**. 

In terms of annual trends, we observed a sharp increase in traffic between **June** and **August**, largely due to the **vacation period**. This influx is driven by both local residents traveling and the many tourists who visit **Ticino** during the summer months.

As for the most congested roads, the areas around **Lugano** and the **A2 motorway**, which leads to the **San Gottardo Pass**, experience the highest traffic volumes. The **A2** serves as a key route for both daily commuters and tourists, contributing to its heavy traffic.
